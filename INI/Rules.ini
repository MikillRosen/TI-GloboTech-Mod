; 28. COMPUTER IQ CONTROLS
;========================================================================================================
; Each player (computer controlled or otherwise) is given an IQ rating that is used
; to control what the computer is allowed to automatically control. This is
; distinct from the difficulty setting. The higher the IQ setting, the more autonomous
; and intelligent the side will behave. Each ability is given a rating that
; indicates the IQ level (or above) that the ability will be granted. Because such
; abilities are automatically performed by the computer, giving a human controlled
; country a high IQ is not recommended. Otherwise the player's units will start to
; automatically "do their own thing"! A human controlled country is presumed to have
; an IQ rating of zero. A computer controlled country has an IQ of 1 or higher.
; When in skirmish mode or when multiplayer AIs are active, the computer IQ is set to
; the maximum.
[IQ]

; 29. COLOURS
;========================================================================================================
; Each country must be assigned a color. This lists the various
; colors available. The values represent the 'hue', 'saturation',
; and 'value'. The 'value' component specifies the maximum brightness
; allowed for the color as the color spread is generated. The 'hue'
; component remains constant. The 'saturation' curves through color
; space as the 'value' component changes such that darker colors
; become more saturated.

; Projectile       = projectile characteristic to use
; ROF              = delay between shots [15 = 1 second at middle speed setting]
; Range            = maximum cell range

; 33. PROJECTILE STATISTICS
;========================================================================================================
; Projectiles describe how and what image to use as the weapon flies
; to its target. Think of the projectile as the "delivery method" used
; to get the warhead to the desired target.

; AA = Can this weapon fire upon flying aircraft (def=no)?
; AG = Can this weapon fire upon ground objects (def=yes)?
; ASW = Is this an Anti-Submarine-Warfare projectile (def=no)?
; Acceleration = amount to increase missile speed (def=3)
; Airburst = Does it try to fly over the target instead of hit it (def=no)?
; Arm = arming delay, in frames (def=0)
; Bouncy = Does it bounce a bit upon impact (def=no)?
; Degenerates = Does the bullet strength weaken as it travels (def=no)?
; Dropping = Does it fall from a starting height (def=no)?
; Elasticity = "bounciness" of the object [should be 0.0 through 1.0] (def=0.75)
; High = Can it fly over walls (def=no)?
; Image = image to use during flight
; Inaccurate = Is it inherently inaccurate (def=no)?
; Inviso = Is the projectile invisible as it travels (def=no)?
; Parachuted = Equipped with a parachute for dropping from plane (def=no)?
; Proximity = Does it blow up when near its target (def=no)?
; ROT = Rate Of Turn [non zero implies homing] (def=0)
; Ranged = Does this projectile blow up if it exceeds the weapon's ProjectileRange (def=no)?
; Shadow = If High, does this bullet need to have a shadow drawn? (def = yes)
; Color = Color scheme to use for special remapping projectiles (def = none)
; VeryHigh = Does it fly at a very high cruise altitude (def=no)?
; Cluster = number of explosions attached to projectile [cluster-bomb] (def=1)

; 36. WARHEAD CHARACTERISTICS
;========================================================================================================
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = damage spread factor [larger means greater spread] (def=1)
;          [A value of 1 means the damage is halved every pixel distant from center point.
;          a value of 2 means damage is halved every 2 pixels, etc.
;          Maximum area of effect is 3x3 cells, excluding the four corner cell spots used by infantry.
;          This creates a roughly circular area.]
; Wall = Does this warhead damage walls and bridges (def=no)?
; Wood = Does this warhead damage trees (def=no)?
; Fire = Does this warhead leave a small residual flame (def=no)?
; Tiberium = Does this warhead destroy Tiberium (def=no)?
; Sparky = Does this warhead ignite trees and buildings [using SmallFire] (def=no)?
; Conventional = Is the warhead big enough to cause a splash when it hits water (def=no)?
; Rocker = Can this warhead cause nearby units to rock upon impact (def=no)?
; AnimList = list of animations to play when warhead explodes [listed from lesser to greater damage]
;            [divide weapon damage by 25 to determine which animation to play (0-based index)]
;            [Warhead verses are ignored in the calculation, but firepower etc. bonuses are not]
; InfDeath = which infantry death animation to use (def=0)
;            [0=instant die, 1=twirl die, 2=explodes, 3=flying death, 4=burn death, 5=electro]
; Deform = % chance that this warhead will damage the ground when it hits. (def=0)
; DeformThreshhold = damage must exceed this amount before deformation can occur (def=0)
; Particle = Particle effect to use when explosion occurs (def=none)
; ProneDamage = Damage modifer for infantry when prone (def=1.0)
;               [also used against JumpJet infantry with Fearless=no]
; Bright = Does this warhead normally cause a lighting effect when it goes off (def=no). This is overridden in the case of bullets by the weapon 'Bright' flag.
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of full damage)...
;           -vs- none (infantry), wood (buildings), light armor, heavy armor, concrete armor (super units and heavy aircraft)
; LimpetFactor = Latches the firer to the target, slowing it down by this percentage (100 completely immobilizes the target) (def=0)

;========================================================================================================
; This specifies the chance for the specified crate powerup to appear
; in a 'random' crate. The chance is expressed in the form of 'shares'
; out of the total shares specified. The second parameter is the animation
; to use when this crate is picked up. The third parameter, if present, specifies
; the data value needed for that crate powerup. They mean different things
; for the different powerups.

; Note if you change these, make sure to change NoBaddieCrates.ini as well

;========================================================================================================
; This specifies the various general behavior characteristics of
; the missions that objects can be assigned. Each of the game objects must
; be in a mission. The mission behavior is generally hard coded into
; the program, but there are some behavior characteristics that can
; be overridden. Don't modify these.

; NoThreat = Is its weapons disabled and thus ignored as a potential target until fired upon (def=no)?
; Zombie = Is forced to sit there like a zombie and never recovers (def=no)?

; Paralyzed = Is the object frozen in place but can still fire and function (def=no)?
; Retaliate = Is allowed to retaliate while on this mission (def=yes)?
; Scatter = Is allowed to scatter from threats (def=yes)?
; Rate = delay between normal processing (larger = faster game, less responsiveness)
; AARate = anti-aircraft delay rate (if not specifed it uses regular rate).
